      <h1>My MCA Project</h1>
	  <p>Welcome to my MCA project. The theme for my dataset is classical music by Gustav Holst, and his works in “The Planets”. 
Because of the popularity of the work, it has been curated in multiple places and ways. There is many different notated data for his pieces, including the original sheet music, and various transcriptions of the music for different instruments, such as a piano arrangement for “Mars, the Bringer of War”. There is also acoustic and descriptive data everywhere for his pieces, including on youtube, iTunes, Spotify etc, where both recordings and live concerts of his pieces can be found. 
</p>
	  <p>Included in this dataset is the additional folders containing other files generated throughout the project.</p>
